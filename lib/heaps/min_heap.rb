# A heap is an efficient semi-ordered data structure for storing a collection of orderable data. A min-heap
# supports two operations:
#
#    INSERT(heap, element)
#    element REMOVE_MIN(heap)
#
# Although different types of heaps exist. The term binary heap and heap are interchangeable in
# most cases. A heap can be thought of as a tree with parent and child. The main difference
# between a heap and a binary tree is the heap property.  In order for a data structure to be
# considered a heap, it must satisfy the following condition (heap property):
#
#    If A and B are elements in the heap and B is a child of A, then key(A) â‰¤ key(B).
#    (This property applies for a min-heap. A max heap would have the comparison reversed).
#     What this tells us is that the minimum key will always remain at the top and greater
#     values will be below it. Due to this fact, heaps are used to implement priority queues
#     which allows quick access to the item with the most priority. Here's an example of a min-heap:
